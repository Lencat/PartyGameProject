# Unnamed Party Game
Our CECS 491 senior group project as part of Team Seven.

Austin, Khoa, Steven, Tou, and Wesley.

## Development Notes
The master branch is for stable, functional versions only. If the game frequently crashes or doesn't start up, don't push to it. Merge requests require the majority of the team to confirm it runs before being finalized.

The dev/* branches are for your own personal branches and updates. Push to dev/main if your code is mostly finished and you want to see how it plays with anyone else's changes before it eventually gets merged into the master branch.
